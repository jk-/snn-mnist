## Spyky

Spyky is a light-weight Machine Learning Framework for Spiking Neural Nets (SNN).

### Spiking Neural Nets (SNN)

A Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a third generation artificial neural network that integrates time into the operating model. Neurons apart of the SNN represent many different types of neurons found in the brain. The difference between a SNN and a standard perceptron network, is that a Neuron in a SNN is only fired when a membrane potential reaches a specific value, called the activation potential.

In this example of training a SNN on the MNIST hand-written digit set, we incorporate a Leaky-Integrate and Fire Neuron (LIF). Each pixel of the input image is normalized and applied to a LIF neuron.

We do 2D convolution on the neurons from twelve kernels to produce a total of twelve feature maps. The hidden layer size is 8,112 connections (26 * 26 * 12). There are a total of 10 output layers (digits 0 - 9). I will implement an inhibitor on the final output layers using a Winner-Take-All (WTA) approach.
